# Last Pencil

A simple but engaging game in Java.

## Stage 1/5:Empty the pencil case
In this stage, the program prints two lines: one line with several vertical bar symbols representing pencils 
(for example, `|||` or `|||||||`) and one `Your turn!` string.

Even though both pencils are acceptable, you can choose to get a large pencil, or a small one, by providing a
boolean value for the argument `largePencil` of the `getPencil()` function

Run [SimplePencil.java](src/main/java/lastpencil/SimplePencil.java)

Example: 

    |||
    Your turn!
